Description: Statistical tooling for host-microbiome dual transcriptomics.
    HoMiStats contains tools for metatranscriptome differential expression and
    for creating co-occurrence networks between host and microbial transcripts.
    Additionally, there are tools for transforming data and 
    performing targeted (knowledge-guided) analyses to look for 
    biologically-plausible associations in gene expression between 
    hosts and microbes.
